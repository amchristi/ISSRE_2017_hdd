\section{Results}
In this section we want to (1) Demonstrate applicability and accuracy of our tool. (2) Study reduced version generated by our methodology. We ask following Research Questions.


\begin{itemize}
\renewcommand{\labelitemi}{$\bullet$}
\item \textbf{RQ1:} How applicable is \mytool\ ?
\item \textbf{RQ2:} How accurate is reductions produced by \mytool\ ?
\item \textbf{RQ3:} What are the size of the reductions produced by our methodology?
\item \textbf{RQ4:} Does reductions occur in small blocks or bigger blocks?
\item \textbf{RQ5:} Can \mytool\ be used to create resource adaptive software system for real world software?
\end{itemize}

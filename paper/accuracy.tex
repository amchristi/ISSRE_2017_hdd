Two factors contribute to inaccuracy of the reductions. (1) Error in the implementation of the tool, this can be fixed (2) As hdd and dd generates local minimum reductions, reduced 1-minimal program is only local minimal and not global minimal. Rarely any reduction tool measures their inaccuracy  against global minimal because local minimum is part of definition of dd. We want to consider local minimum as a contributing factor in inaccuracy. Any missed reductions produces bigger program then the true minimum program. We measure accuracy by choosing 20 random reductions and comparing it against reductions generated by hand. We calculate precision and recall using the standard definitions:

$precision =  \dfrac{\emph{TruePositive}}{ \emph{TruePositive} + \emph{FalsePositive}}$ 

$recall =  \dfrac{\emph{TruePositive}}{ \emph{TruePositive} + \emph{FalseNegative}}$ 

We found \mytool\ has precision of 100\% and recall of 94\%. This means, all the reductions applied by \mytool\ were correct but \mytool\ missed 6\% of potential reductions. (Alex, Rahul: This numbers are dummy, will be updated soon.)

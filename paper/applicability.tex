\mytool\ is complete in Java 7 statements specified in japa.parser.ast.stmt, as long as java parser can parse a program, \mytool\ can reduce it. As \mytool\ is going to be used my developers in practice (at least by the developers of TSA), we want it to have high applicability and hence we are maintaining it well. Because it is complete in statements, we expect it to be highly applicable. During our experiments, we run into issues where \mytool\ threw exception, but we continued to fix it along the way. For the current 21 classes, consisting of total 6781 lines of non comment, non empty code and 408 methods, \mytool\ is 100\% applicable. Among 22 distinct statement types captured by java parser, 21 of them were encountered at least 1 time during our reduction of 21 classes, again demonstrating applicability of the tool. If program uses java 8  features like functional programming using stream, \mytool\ is unable to reduce statements with this feature and currently it ignores them, though it will continue to reduce rest of the program as it is. We are planning to address this in future.

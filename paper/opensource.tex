Original delta debugging work defines different notions of minimality for reduction in detail \cite{ddOriginal}. For our further discussion, we define 1-minimal program or 1-minimal mutant as follows. It is important to note that this is local minimal as DD or HDD are greedy and our algorithm is also greedy \cite{ddOriginal, hddOriginal}. Given a program P and a  test suite T, we define 1-minimal (local) program P' of P is the reduced version of P such that all tests continue to pass and the program cannot be reduced any further. For component level adaptations, the idea of 1-minimality is applied at a component level. The intention of \mytool is to output the 1-minimal program for a given program given a test suite such that all tests continue to pass.

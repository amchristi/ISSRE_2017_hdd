The challenges that we faced are very similar to other reduction tools. 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Non complilable code - Most of other tools discussed in this paper, just revert the code if code is not compilable at any step of reduction. This issue is not present in our implementation by design, we attempt to produce code that compiles only. Though we still compile at the end of each reduction step (just like other tools) in order to make sure that our reductions are at any point of time are compilable indeed. Because of our proactive approach, we are able to avoid reverting, one of the most time consuming step, reverting mostly require writing back java files. 
\item Infinite loops - This problem is just not avoidable as reduction can delete loop control statements. We employ very crude strategy of providing some threshold and giving up if the threshold is hit and returning Fail as result of tests. 
\item Local minimum - As mentioned earlier, nature of ddmin or hdd just produces local minimum and as our tool is built on hdd, our tool also produces local minimum program.

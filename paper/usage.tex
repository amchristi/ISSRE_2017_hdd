Tool takes as its input, a program (or a component if only component needs to be reduced), a test suite or a tester, a build system and produces a \emph{minimally reduced program} such that all test cases continue to pass.  Though right now it works as a stand alone tool with JUnit tests only, the tool is very extendable and flexible to accommodate any other testing technologies. Just like JUnitTester in the ~\ref{fig:figDetailedToolArch}, providing an extra implementation, NUnitTester, will make the tool capable of working with any java projects consisting of NUnit test suite out of the box. Tool can be easily extended to work with other arbitrary tester by implementing a simple interface that consists of only one method. We were able to extend it for TSA system under consideration that has a customized tester written in python by implementing the interface using less then 70 lines of java code. Tool is made available as command line tool with many flexible options giving developers very fine control over how it can be used. Tool can be used at method level, class level, program level or component level giving its user finer control over reduction.
